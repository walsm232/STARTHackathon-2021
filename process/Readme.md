## Product Development

To conceptualise the idea of making work from home fun and effective, our team used **Miro Board** to go through various product development process. 
The idea was to work on virtual white board where we all can collaborate and brainstorm. This made us feel more connected and productive.

Exercises we performed to finally reach to our end goal of how to make the remote working a possible option in future.

1. **HWM** - how we might questions where we all came up with different issues in this work setting and tried embedding our understanding of the problem case discussed by Accenture
2. **Catgorizing & Voting** - we moved around the how we might notes to come with common themes & voted for HWM we think are important to tackle -
        - cultural and social interacting issue (Onboarding)
        - Productivity Transparency & Traceability 
        - time efficiency
        - Health & wellbeing
3. **Long Term Goals** - Looking at the bigger picture and future scope of the product we all had our own 2 year view of this idea and we voted for most plausible goal we aim
4. **Drawing the Map & Aligning HWM's** - We then looked at the product from our end user perspective like employees and employers in our case and aligned our HWMs and created 
   stages where they might tackle the problem. Once we had our end goal decided, we concluded we wanted to make WFH fun, collaborative and interactive instead of monotone and 
   silo framework
5. **Lighting demos** - We went over the internet to get inpired by similar concept products and use as examples.
6. **Concept Sketching** - We did had some idea about the product in our minds and it was time to pen down and vote for best features and it was very meaningful as it helped us 
   in joining our product vision into one wholesome product
7. **Solution presentation** - This was the final stage whoch helped us to bring our previous research and designs and reason why that concept/design made sense to meet our end goal

We went through the entire exercise in 6 hours but felt it important so that all team members walk through that journey of ideation and it's now time to realize the goal
of making WFH fun by creating a web app/portal where all employees can start their conversations and anyone can join the breakout rooms with them. No prior scheduling 
or outlook invites. At the same time, app is flexible enough to provide personalize experience to remain about coffee breaks, movement when sitting for long hours,
learn what other co-workers are engaging in and opportunity for management to interact in informal way with employees.
